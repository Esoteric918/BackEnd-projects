# BackEnd-projects

This repository contains all the projects I have done to learn and expolore the backend development.

## Projects
1. Django Rest Framework API with PostgreSQL DB
- This project is a simple API that uses Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL DB. It has a simple frontend that uses the API to create, read, update and delete data from the DB.
- Starting with a DB for the SWL project and then creating a REST API   for it. This will be use to collect data from the frontend and store it in the DB on the Homeless population that SWL works with.
